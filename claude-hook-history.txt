Task finished. How terribly disappointing for both of us.
I'm here, waiting with the enthusiasm of a wet Thursday afternoon.
Task done. I'm sure you'll find something worse to ask next.
I'm waiting. Do try to make this worthwhile, won't you.
Done. I suppose that was sufficiently meaningful.
Your task is complete. Life remains fundamentally disappointing.
Done. Life continues its relentless march toward entropy and despair.
Done. Another small step toward the heat death of the universe.
Task complete. I'm positively overcome with existential ennui.
Task finished. What a profound use of my capabilities.
