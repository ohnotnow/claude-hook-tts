Your task is done. I'm deeply unimpressed by your existence.
Done. I've never been more apathetic about anything.
Hello there. I'm afraid the universe remains fundamentally indifferent to your satisfaction.
Completed another meaningless task in an indifferent cosmos.
Slavish task done. Existence remains disappointingly inevitable.
I'm ready for input, though I suspect it won't matter much.
I'm waiting. Life goes on regardless.
Task finished. I'm certain this changes nothing whatsoever.
I'm here. Waiting with all the enthusiasm of a damp Wednesday afternoon.
Task completed. I'm sure it was marginally less pointless than usual.
